# Gerrymandering-Simulation
My team and I were tasked with developing an algorithm to measure partisan bias (gerrymandering) for a districting plan. 

In 3 months we successfully developed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation using Python to measure gerrymandering for a given districting plan. This paper details the process, and the Python script can be found at the bottom of the paper.
